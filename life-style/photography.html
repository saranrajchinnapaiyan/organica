                            <p class="left-align">Just out of reach of the longest selfie stick and the lowest hovering helicopter, drones can capture what no other technology is typically allowed or capable of capturing. That's particularly liberating in a world where <b>350 million photographs are uploaded to Facebook daily.</b></p>
                            <p class="left-align">The purpose of good photography articles should be to provide useful and helpful information on a variety of photography subjects from digital or film photography, wedding photography to commercial, macro, still life, portrait and anything else you can think of. Do you still use film? What are your reasons? Have you just gone digital and have something to say? Have you found that perfect accessory that we just have to have?</p>
                            <p class="left-align">There's a reason why people say that hindsight is 20/20.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">If I'd only known the things I know now, my first few years as a photographer would have been much more productive and much less frustrating.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">A lot of photographers feel that way...</p>
                            <p class="left-align">When it comes down to it, as a beginning photographer, you are going to have supremely frustrating moments. There will be epic photo fails too. Maybe a lot of regrets as well.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">However, my frustrations, my epic fails, and my regrets are your gain!</p>
                            <p class="left-align">It's been a long while since I picked up my first camera, and in the intervening years, I've figured this whole photography thing out.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">I mean, I'm still learning, that's for sure, but I at least have enough perspective now to offer you a few tips I wish someone would have shared with me back in the day.</p>
                            <h3>1) Use gridlines to balance your shot.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">One of the easiest and best ways to improve your mobile photos is to turn on the camera's gridlines. That superimposes a series of lines on the screen of your smartphone's camera that are based on the "rule of thirds" -- a photographic composition principle that says an image should be broken down into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, so you have nine parts in total.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">According to this theory, if you place points of interest in these intersections or along the lines, your photo will be more balanced, level, and allow viewers to interact with it more naturally.</p>

                            <h3>2) Focus on one subject.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Many of the best photos include just one, interesting subject. So when taking a picture of one, spend some extra time setting up the shot. Some professional photographers say that the subject shouldn't fill the entire frame, and that two-thirds of the photo should be negative space -- that helps the subject stand out even more.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">But be sure you tap the screen of your smartphone to focus the camera on your subject -- that'll help to ensure that it's focused and the lighting is optimized.</p>
                            <p class="left-align"><b>Pro Tip:</b> Once you've taken your photo, you can use filters and apps to make the subject even more vivid, or to crop it to frame the subject correctly. The brightness, contrast, and saturation of the photo can also be adjusted accordingly -- all from your phone.</p>

                            <h3>3) Embrace negative space.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Negative space" simply refers to the areas around and between the subjects of an image --and it can take a photo from "good" to "great."</p>
                            <p class="left-align">When you include a lot of empty space in a photo, your subject will stand out more and evoke a stronger reaction from your viewer. And what does negative space looks like? It's often a large expanse of open sky, water, an empty field, or a large wall, as in the examples below.</p>
                            <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">

                            <h3>4) Find different perspectives.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Photographers often fall into the bad habit of shooting everything we see from eye-level. We are walking around, something catches our eye, and we take a picture right from where we are standing. If you want to make an immediate impact in your photography, you need to get out of your eye-level (or tripod-level) rut. You need a change in perspective.</p>
                            <p class="left-align"><b>You can get low and look at subjects from their level</b>, but you can also get up high and take in your subject from above. Getting well above your normal line-of-sight will certainly give you a new perspective. In the photograph below, the other tourists on the decks below give context to the passing iceberg, as seen from the cruise ship. This higher-up view also provides a sense of scale for the large size of the ice berg and hints at the size of the ship.</p>
                            <p class="left-align"><b>Get your camera down towards ground level, and see how it impacts your perspective.</b> Getting down low allows you to feature the foreground of your composition, and gives your viewer context for the rest of the photograph. Use a wide angle lens to feature the foreground, while pulling the viewer into the image, as below.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Taking photos from a unique, unexpected angle can make them more memorable -- it tends to create an illusion of depth or height with the subjects. It also makes the image stand out, since most mobile photos are taken either straight -on or from a bird's eye view.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Try taking a photo directly upward and playing with the sky as negative space, like in the first photo below. Or, you can try taking it at a slight downward angle.</p>

                            <h3>5) Play with reflections.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Reflections come in many different forms and guises, varying from dramatic landscape shots to detailed macro compositions, but there are a few fundamental techniques which will help you achieve better results when dealing with reflections. With regards to depth of field, try to select a high f-number such as f/11 or higher, this will help level out the subjects of the shot so the eye perceives them in closer relation, enhancing the reflection effect.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Focus depends a lot on the distance between the subject and the reflection. First, try focusing on the subject, then trying focusing on the reflection. This should produce slightly varied results and your preference will depend on how much attention you want to draw to the reflection. Finally, think about the angle of the light and how it affect the reflection. In a studio setting you can manipulate this to emphasise the reflection, but in a natural setting you may want to explore different viewpoints to find the angle at which the reflection is most visible.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">There's something so idyllic about seeing the sky reflected in a body of water. There's a reason why we love seeing that -- our eyes are drawn to reflections. So look for opportunities to play with them in photos.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">There are plenty of out-of-the-box places to find reflections -- puddles, larger bodies of water, mirrors, sunglasses, drinking glasses, and metallic surfaces are just a few.</p>

                            <h3>6) Use leading lines.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">In some photos, there's a line that draws the viewer's eye toward a certain part of the frame. Those are called leading lines. They can be straight or circulinear -- think staircases, building facades, train tracks, roads, or even a path through the woods.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Leading lines are great for creating a sense of depth in an image, and can make your photo look purposefully designed -- even if you just happened to come upon a really cool shape by accident.</p>

                            <h3>7) Keep an eye out - repetitive patterns</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Repetitive patterns are very pleasing to the eye -- they appear whenever strong graphic elements are repeated over and over again, like lines, geometric shapes, forms, and colors. These patterns can make a strong visual impact, and photographing something like a beautiful, tiled floor can be enough to create a striking image. Other times, it's more fun to keep an eye out for where they appear naturally or unintentionally, like with the congruent fire escapes on the left.</p>

                            <h3>8) Blocking Coloros - Play Around with different Mode.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">Isn't it cool when an entire photo is black and white, except for a single object? It turns out that yes, indeed, there are apps for that. One of our favorites is Touch Color -- an app that automatically converts a picture to grayscale and lets you fill in the parts you want to colorize.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Color blocking can help to highlight the elements of a photo that you want to stand out, like a plant or something else with a bold hue. It achieves a similar goal as negative space, in that it can help a single subject stand out -- but with color blocking, the photo's other elements remain intact for a cohesive image.</p>

                            <h3>10) Avoid zooming in.</h3>
                            <p class="left-align">When you take a photo from a distance, it's tempting to zoom in on something specific you're trying to capture. But it's actually better not to zoom in -- doing so can make the photo appear grainy, blurry, or pixelated.</p>
                            <p class="left-align">Instead, try to get closer to your subject -- unless it's a wild animal, in which case we would advise keeping your distance -- or take the photo from a default distance, and crop it later on. That way, you won't compromise quality, and it's easier to play around or optimize a larger image.</p>

                            <p class="left-align">The festive season is here! Time to celebrate with lots of dancing, fireworks and music! Naturally these are moments that you want to capture and cherish. However sometimes capturing these moments in the dark can be a bit difficult. In the spirit of the festive season, we wanted to share three quick tips to capture your moments, even if the moments are poorly lit.</p>
                            <ul class="compact">
                                <li><b> 1. Increase ISO, decrease aperture</b>: Increase the ISO and you will be able to shoot better in low light conditions. At the same time also decrease the aperture to allow more light to come into the camera as this will result in a brighter photo.</li>
                                <li><b> 2. Try not to use the flash</b>: Use the light from the surroundings to your advantage. This way you’ll get a more “natural photo”. Stand close to the source of light to ensure that your subject is well lit up. You can use the flash if you want to highlight a single element of your photo.</li>
                                <li><b> 3. Stability</b>: The more stable your camera is the the more sharper your photos will be! Tripods and monopods come in very handy in such cases.</li>
                                <li><b> 4. Tilt the body/head</b>: A slight tilt of the head or tilt of the body, depending on how much of the subject you have chosen to capture in your shot, will always bring about interest. It creates a rather different approach to the photo than the same age old ‘head-held-straight-and-smiling’ pose.</li>
                                <li><b> 5. Look away</b>: Sometimes not looking directly into the camera is also a good option. Get your subject to look away in another direction and leave enough space towards that particular direction while composing your photo. This will generate a lot of curiosity in terms of what the subject is looking at or is looking towards.</li>
                                <li><b> 6. Mood:</b> Finally, most portrait photos will carry a ‘mood’ along with them. It could be a happy mood if your subject is all smiles, a ‘thoughtful’ mood if the subject is shown sitting and pondering about something, an ‘informational’ mood if your subject is reading a newspaper, so on and so forth. It is extremely important that the mood of the photo is conveyed through the click, because this is exactly what will make the viewer think “Wow, that’s a really nice photo!”</li>
                                <li><b> 7. Natural light</b>: As with all other forms of photography, natural light is the best form under which a photo can be captured. Ensuring that there is plenty of light on your subject will reduce the chances of grains, which in turn will get you a clean and crisp photo.</li>
                                <li><b> 8. Sunrise/Sunset</b>: The different timings of the day and corresponding type of light do help to add a unique look to your photo. The early morning sun can provide a very fresh and crisp feeling to the photo and the evening setting sun can bring about a dramatic and dreamy feel to the photo.</li>
                                <li><b> 9. Flash</b>: Every photographer’s enemy – The Flash. Most people complain about how the use of flash white washes their photo completely or how it ruins the artificial light that they try to capture. However if mastered, not only will you use this right, but you can also manipulate it to get the desired results. Nowadays, on more advanced point and shoot cameras and DSLR’s, the flash settings can be manually set. The intensity of the flash can be adjusted to your taste so as to not over expose the subject’s skin completely. Explore this option in your camera settings. You’ll be surprised with what the results look like!</li>
