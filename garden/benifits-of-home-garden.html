                        <h1>The Benifits of Gardening</h1>
                        <p class="left-align">Customers may wonder "Why should I start to garden or landscape?" The real question at hand should be, why shouldn't you garden? Schulte's greenhouse has the plants and resources for any customer to be a successful gardener and develop that desired "green thumb." Gardening can provide much more than adding beauty to your yard. Let Schulte's show you the numerous benefits of gardening.</p>
                        <h2>1. Gardening is good for your mind and body</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Gardening is a great form of exercise. Besides obvious weight lose benefits gardening has been proven to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, and decrease depression. In fact, studies show that merely looking at a garden or plants can generate changes in such things as blood pressure, heart activity, muscle tension, and brain electrical activity. Through colors and textures gardeners can invoke emotions of calm, tranquility, and happiness. Gardening is more than a feel good pastime; it has evolved into a form of therapy for our body and soul.</p>
                        <h2>2. Impact the environment</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">We always hear about the negative impact humans have on the environment, but by gardening we can truly "go green" to benefit the earth. Plants act as highly effective air cleaners, absorbing carbon dioxide, plus many air pollutants, while releasing clean oxygen and fragrance. Also, a dense cover of plants and mulch holds soil in place, reducing erosion and keeping sediment out of streams, storm drains and roads.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">By planting new gardens, such as rain gardens, we can make use of the rain water run-off and help prevent harmful pollutants from making it in our streams and lakes. Native gardens, like rain gardens, are not only good for the environment they are low maintenance, beautiful, and easy on the wallet!. Besides being good for the environment gardens have environmental gains for us. It has been proven that an effective, environmental landscape design can cool your home in summer and warm it in winter. Energy efficient landscaping can actually reduce your energy costs by up to 20%, according to the Plants for Clean Air Council.</p>
                        <h2>3. Increase property value</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">A garden/landscaping design can be considered an investment for the future. A tastefully designed yard can add "curb-appeal" to your house and in turn increase the overall value of ones home. Besides adding monetary value a garden can help one sell their house faster than the average home owner.</p>
                        <h2>4. Growing green</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">A vegetable garden will ensure customers of the freshness and quality of what they are eating. In this day and age where pesticides and fertilizers are overused consider the comfort you will have when you know exactly what has touched your fruits and veggies! Plus a vegetable garden is a great way to gain responsibility and personal satisfaction.</p>
                        <h2>5. Self satisfaction</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Gardening and landscaping is truly becoming an art form. Planning, planting and watching your own garden grow can fill a person with satisfaction and pride. Gardening is truly a life-time hobby. The more you learn the more proficient one gets and the possibilities become endless. </p>
                        <h2>6. Easy Access</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">A home garden gives you instant access to fresh produce, so that you're not forced to visit the grocery store or farmers market to find it. You save time and money on gasoline rather than driving somewhere else to buy your produce. Depending on the type of vegetables you plant, you'll also save money on the food itself. Growing vegetables at home does cost money on seeds and supplies, such as fertilizer, but a single plant often produces lots of produce, so that you often save money by growing your own. A backyard garden opens up new flavoring options or recipes. For example, if you feel like serving salsa but don't have a jar on hand, you can use tomatoes, peppers and onions from your garden to make your own.</p>
                        <h2>7. Control</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Growing your own food gives you complete control over the chemicals and products used during the growing process. Organic produce typically costs more at the grocery store, but you can grow your own organic fruits and vegetables at home by skipping the chemical fertilizers and pesticides. A home garden allows you to pick the produce when it is ripe, unlike produce at the store that is often harvested before it is fully ripe. The flavor and quality of the freshly picked produce from a home garden is superior to store-bought produce with unknown chemicals that was likely picked several days or weeks before being sold. The produce retains more nutrients when consumed shortly after harvesting, making your homegrown vegetables a healthier option.</p>
                        <h2>8. Lower your grocery bill</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">If you have a small yard, you may think you don’t have enough space to grow food for your family. However, it only takes about a tenth of an acre to produce most of the vegetables one person will eat in an entire year, according to gardening expert Maria Iannotti. Even a small garden plot can produce significant food. For example, you could grow the five tomato plants mentioned above in only about 30 square feet if you trellis them. Even if you have no yard, many vegetables are easy to grow in containers on your porch or balcony.</p>
                        <h2>9. Help save the bees</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Planting a backyard garden is an excellent way to ensure that the bees and other beneficial pollinating insects survive in your area. Although many common garden vegetables, such as cucumber and squash, have flowers that attract bees, planting flowers and herbs in your backyard garden will make them even happier.</p>
                        <h2>10. Enjoyment</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">For many homeowners, planting a garden provides enjoyment. Watching your garden go from bare ground to ripe produce or beautiful plants offers a sense of satisfaction. Some gardeners find the activity relaxing and stress-relieving, for overall mental health benefits. Caring for the plants gives the entire family a chance to work together. If you have neighbors who also garden, the activity sometimes offers social interaction. Gardening also offers a form of moderate outdoor exercise.</p>
                        <p class="left-align"><b>One last reason to start a garden may be the biggest bonus of all: gardening builds community.</b></p>
                        <p class="left-align">It seems that few people know their neighbors anymore, but when you spend time outside in your yard you may find yourself chatting with the neighbor over the garden fence. And once you realize you have planted more green beans or tomatoes than you could ever use, you’ll be surprised how delighted people are when they see you come their way!</p>
