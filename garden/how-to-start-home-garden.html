                        <h1>Initial Considerations</h1>
                        <p class="left-align">Spring is a good time to begin growing and digging, although planning can take place before the snow melts. Gardeners spend most of the summer watering, weeding, and watching young plants grow. Fall is a good time to plant trees, shrubs, bulbs, and some perennials.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Get an idea!</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Is this going to be a vegetable garden? An herb garden? A flower garden? If you choose to grow flowers, do you want annuals, which you must replant each year but which give color most of the summer? Or do you prefer perennials, which have a shorter bloom time but come back year after year? You can mix any of the above -- after all, it's your garden. Just one bit of advice: Start small. 'Tis better to succeed just a little, than to fail grandly.</p>
                        <h2>Pick a place</h2>
                        <p class="left-align"> Almost all vegetables and most flowers need about six hours of full sun each day. Spend a day in your chosen spot and watch how the sun moves across the space. It might receive more sun than you think. But don't despair if your lot is largely sunless; many plants tolerate shade. Check plant tags or ask the staff at your local garden center to find out how much sun a plant requires. Put the garden where you can't ignore its pleas for attention -- outside the back door, near the mailbox, by the window you stare out when you dry your hair. Place it close enough to a water spigot that you won't have to drag the hose to the hinterlands.</p>
                        <h2>Clear the ground</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Get rid of the sod covering the area you plan to plant. If you want quick results, you can dig it out, but it's easier to smother it with newspaper. A layer of five sheets is usually thick enough; double that if your lawn is Bermudagrass or St. Augustine grass. Spread a 3-inch layer of compost (or combination of potting soil and topsoil) on the newspaper and wait. It'll take about four months for the compost and paper to decompose.</p>
                        <h2>Preparing the Soil</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">In order to get the best results with your new organic garden, you'll want to make sure the soil is properly conditioned. You have to eat, and so do plants, so make sure your veggies get lots of fresh nutrients. Good healthy soil helps build up strong, productive plants. Chemical soil treatments can not only seep into your food, but they can also harm the beneficial bacteria, worms and other microbes in the soil.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">The best way to gauge the quality of your soil is to get it tested. You can get a home testing kit, or better, send a sample to your local agricultural extension office. For a modest fee you'll get a complete breakdown of pH and nutrient levels, as well as treatment recommendations (be sure to tell them you're going organic). That way you can tailor your gardening program. Typically, it's best to test in the fall, and apply any organic nutrients before winter.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Even if you don't have time for testing, you'll want to make sure your soil has plenty of humus -- the organic matter, not the similarly named Mediterranean spread. Manure should be composted, unless you aren't going to harvest or plant anything for two months after application. Preferably, get your manure from local livestock that have been organically and humanely raised -- and never use manure from animals that eat meat.</p>
                        <h2>Choose the Right Plants</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">It really pays to select plants that will thrive in your specific micro-conditions. As a general guide don't forget to check the USDA's Hardiness Zones (which have recently been updated by the National Arbor Day Foundation due to climate change). Choose plants that will be well adjusted to each spot, in terms of light, moisture, drainage and soil quality. Most gardens have gradations in these variables. The happier your plants are, the more resistant they'll be to attackers.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">If you're buying seedlings, look for plants raised without chemical fertilizers and pesticides. A great place to look is at your local farmers' market, which may also have native plants and varieties well suited to your area. It's better to buy stocky seedlings with few, if any blooms yet, and with roots that don't look overcrowded.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Many things are best grown from seed, including sunflowers, annual poppies, evening-scented stock (Matthiola bicornis), coriander, dill, annual phlox (Phlox drummondii), larkspur, annual lupine, morning glories, sweet peas, squash and cucumbers.</p>
                        <h2>Plant Crops in Wide Beds</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Plants that you will be harvesting, such as vegetables or cutting flowers, should be grouped tightly in beds that you don't walk on (raised beds work great). Grouping reduces weeding and water waste, and helps you target compost and nutrients. Easier path maintenance helps lead to healthy soil. Ample space between rows helps promote air circulation, which repels fungal attacks.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Remember that seedlings won't always stay diminutive, and you do want to try to limit over shadowing. It's a good idea to thin crops based on nursery suggestions.</p>
                        <p class="left-align"> If you have limited space and time, and want the highest returns of fresh organic produce, these plants are typically winners:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Indeterminate Tomatoes. So named because the vines keep getting bigger and producing new fruit until they are felled by frost.</li>
                            <li>2. Non-Hybrid (Old-Fashioned) Pole Beans. They keep growing and producing 'til frost -- assuming you keep them picked.</li>
                            <li>3. Zucchini. Everything they say about avalanches of zucchini is true, especially of hybrid varieties.</li>
                            <li>4. Swiss Chard. You can keep breaking off outer leaves for months, and every picking will be tender as long as plants get enough water.</li>
                            <li>5. Tall Snow Peas and Sugarsnaps. They grow readily and produce delicious rewards.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Proper Watering</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">The best time to water plants is usually in the morning. Why? Mornings tend to be cool and without strong winds, so the amount of water lost to evaporation is reduced. If you water in the evening plants stay damp over night, making them more likely to be damaged by fungal and bacterial diseases.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Ideally, you want to water the roots, not the greenery, which is easily damaged. A drip or soak system can work great, or just carefully water the bases of plants by hand.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Most experts recommend substantial, infrequent watering for established plants, typically a total of about one inch of water per week (including rain). One or two applications a week encourages deeper rooting, which promotes stronger plants. To avoid shocking tender greenery, try to use water at or near air temperature (collected rainwater is best).</p>
                        <p class="left-align">With population growth and climate change putting increasing pressure on our precious freshwater supplies, it is becoming more important than ever to save water.</p>
                        <h2>Weeding!</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Ah weeding. Even if you live in the Biosphere, you'll still get weeds, since their tiny seeds are pervasive. Pulling weeds by hand may sound like hard work -- and it can be -- but it also can be good exercise, and gets you outside in the fresh air. You don't want to pour toxic chemicals on your food, or where your children and pets play, right?</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Straw is cheap but doesn't last long. Wood chips are nice, but can get pricey. Many people opt to use lawn clippings, although it should be noted that because they are high in nitrogen, clippings should only be used on plants that need a lot of the nutrient, such as squash and lettuce.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">If you get tired of weeding or aren't able to bend over, consider hiring some neighborhood kids. It's a good way to get to know others in your community. Remember too that raised beds can be made wheelchair accessible, and others can take advantage of wheeled stools, arthritis-friendly gardening tools and other equipment.</p>
                        <h2>Harvesting!</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">Don't forget to harvest the fruits of your labor! Fresh organic produce also makes great gifts, educating your friends, neighbors and coworkers. Generally, the more you harvest, the more your plants will produce for you.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">During peak harvest season, you'll likely find that it's best to check your garden every day. Got herbs? If you use them fresh pick them right before you need them. But if you'll be drying and storing them, it's best to wait until just before they flower, since they'll have the most flavor. Gather all herbs except basil in mid morning, shortly after dew has dried. Harvest basil in the late afternoon, since it will last longer after some time in the sun. It's best not to wash herbs before you dry or use them, since that can leach flaor (extra incentive for growing organic!).</p>
                        <p class="left-align">When harvesting leafy greens pick sporadically from the entire crop, a little from each plant. For broccoli, wait until the central head is as large as it will get, before sending off buds for flowering. Cut it off right above the leaf node, and you'll likely get better production from the rest of the plant. In general, it's best to cut produce off with a sharp knife or scissors, versus ripping with your fingers, which can cause more damage to plant tissue</p>
                        <h2>Cleanup</h2>
                        <p class="left-align">If you have sick plants to remove, either during the season or at the end of the year, make sure you pull up the entire organism. Don't forget to rake up underneath, since diseased leaves can harbor problems for a long time. Put all infected material deep in the woods, in the ground at least a foot deep, or on the bonfire.</p>
                        <p class="left-align">Most healthy or expired plants can actually be left in place over winter. You'll provide some food and habitat for birds and other wildlife, and plant cover can help protect your soil from eroding. It's better to chop off annuals then yank them out, because that way you'll leave soil intact, and help prevent weeds from gaining a foothold.</p>
                        <h2>Instructions</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose what you're going to grow. Good options for container gardening include herbs such as basil, sage, and mint; red and green lettuce; and tomatoes.</li>
                            <li>Purchase or build your container. For herbs and lettuce, it should be a shallow container with a large surface area and a screened bottom that allows the roots to aerate. For tomatoes, use a deeper container, such as a bucket. (See above for details.)</li>
                            <li>Find a sunny spot for your herbs and vegetables. Herbs and lettuce need at least a couple hours of good sun per day; tomatoes need full sun.</li>
                            <li>Fill the container with 2-4 inches of compost soil. If you're planting sprouts, make sure to give them a few inches of space around the roots. If you're planting seeds, scatter the seeds evenly across the planter.</li>
                            <li>Keep a couple of containers of each plant going at once, so that when you've clipped one plant, you have another one ready for your next meal.</li>
                            <li>Water your plants regularly. Herbs should have somewhat damp soil—don't let your shallow planters dry out. Tomatoes, on the other hand, are easy to over-water. Feel the soil before you water them. If it's moist, wait until it's dry before watering. Water around the base of the plant, rather than through the leaves.</li>
                            <li>Use a hand-held garden cultivator (a claw) to aerate the surface soil without disturbing the roots too much.</li>
                            <li>Herbs and lettuce take about 2-3 weeks to grow from a sprout into enough to cook with. If you keep a couple of containers going, you can cultivate/reseed/replant every 2 weeks to keep a constant supply going.</li>
                            <li>To harvest your plants, use scissors to snip the leaves or vegetables. Snip the leaves around the base of the plant first, so that it will continue to grow and fill out.</li>
                            <li>At the end of the growing season, you can store your compost soil. Next year, turn your soil over and reseed it for a new crop.</li>
